    description: `These set of four vibrant tasselled torans are made from scrap fabric, and combine the fun of a festive toran and the elegance of sustainability. Made by the members of a women’s livelihood project in Tamil Nadu, these torans feature nine segments, all in cotton. They come in different designs and colours, and are perfect to adorn your home, or a friend’s.
    This set of four torans are a steal at the price, and makes for a great return gift for any auspicious occasion.`,
    story: `Its number in the catalogue is AR120. Its specs are also nondescrpt: it's a single zipper bag with a width of 13.5” and a height of 14” with a strap length of 11”. A mathematical calculation may tell you its volume is nearly 444 cubic inches, but it holds much more within. It holds the hopes of the woman after whom it is named. Arayee, one of the 12 artisans at Thoorigai (meaning ‘quill’ in Tamil), has been with the livelihood project in Perambalur in Tamil Nadu for over 12 years, and has grown with the organization.`,
